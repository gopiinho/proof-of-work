# RocketPool rETH and Liquid Staking

## **What is rocket pool ?**

RocketPool is a decentralized ETH staking protocol allowing validators and stakers to stake their ETH.

## **Why use rocket pool ?**

Because running a validator node requires

- 32 ETH
- Technical knowledge

So rocket pools allows multiple stakers to stake their ETH using rocket pool contracts without needing full 32 ETH or technical knowledge.

## What is rETH ?

rETH us a token issued by rocket pool upon staking your ETH.

It is not necessarily 1:1 to ETH, since its a yield bearing token and is usually more valuable than ETH, currently trading for 1 ETH = 0.88 rETH

ETH/rETH = Amount of ETH backed by 1 rETH

To acquire rETH we can directly stake with its contracts or buy from secondary markets like, uniswap, curve.

rETH is a rebase token.

## **Rebase vs non-rebase token**

### **Rebase**

Rebase token is a token which supply is based on a algorithm, for ex. Lido with its **stETH**

For example a user deposits 10 ETH and gets 10 stETH in return.
After X amount of time their stETH holdings become 11 without any interactions since its a rebase token and they will be able to exchange that 11 stETH > 11 ETH.

This is because their ETH acquired staking rewards which they receive in form of their stETH increasing in supply.

**Token supply and balances change algorithmically over time without user interaction**

### **Non-rebase**

A non-rebase tokens total supply does not dependent on an algorithm but rather events such as mint / burn.

For example a user deposits 10 ETH and gets 10 rETH in return.
After that X amount of time after accumulating their staking rewards they will be able to exchange their 10 rETH > 11 ETH since its a yield bearing token that accrues value.

**ETH/rETH = Amount of ETH backed by 1 rETH**
